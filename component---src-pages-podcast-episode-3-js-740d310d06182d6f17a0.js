Ha, we dreaded the smell so there was a, ah, a ruckus then we said to the powers to be, this is no good there are French, there are Italians there are Greeks and there are German, there are Swiss. We can co, cook better than you Australian people. Nah! I don't think? Well, let’s try it? Do you wanna do it? Yes! Alright, so you got one day to prove it. 1 day, 1 midday and 1 evening meal.

But Wangaratta was not my destiny I thought after 6 months I'll be going to somewhere else. I set my aim to have roughly about 6 months in each place and and travel Australia. The first six months in Wangaratta as an upholsterer, the next six months into Melbourne so I went to Melbourne. I got into a meat factory. Meat! Again to the mutton! Ah shocking, shocking and we used to pull the tongues and all that ! Oh, now I can't even, no it’s terrible! Terrible! Just shocking!

So Horst was my friend and I, after a short stint about a week or two, he was out on his ear. So then we looked through the papers and the army started to recruit so we, mind you, as Germans, Ha Ha, walked to the army headquarters and asked to be to be employed for the army. They said, “what do you think you’re doing? You’re the enemy!” Ah, Ha Ha!"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"So we said alright alright where can we go? So the, the railway were, were looking for cleaners so both of us went in as cleaners. We used to travel with a little hand cart and deliver paint and other things to the outlying areas there in Williamstown, at the railway yards and I just by chance walked through the upholstery place and I asked the foreman do you want any upholsterers? Yes! We need some! I said alright, I’m an upholsterer. Well, he said, show me? So I showed him. Ooh, yes you can start straight away. So I stayed in the upholstery section and my friend Horst was kept as a cleaner, it didn't last long because you had to stay strict to protocol and outside in the area like in Wangaratta when I used to do couches and that we had to do it within a day. At the railways, we had 48 hours to do the same work and that didn't suit me because, you had to do a job and then unpick it and do a job, the same job, and unpick it again because you were working too fast. And they couldn’t have that. So, we didn’t last long and yeah, we left, Horst and I left. And this time we went to Adelaide.

So we went out and they had Nissen huts for the people and we went in and we got given a room, we got in with our goods and chattels and cleaned out and swept and carried on and the people said “Hey those German’s, they’re going to stay here for 3 or 4 years, the way they clean up and put their curtains up and everything. Next morning out into the field and down ah, into the creek up to be a waste in the creek and dig gravel up and put it on a platform and then hoist the platform up and there was a guy up on top of the hill and he directed the crane driver to bring the gravel across to the other side and all the while, while this thing is hoisted up, rocks are falling down on us, no helmet so we didn’t get any helmets and no, no safety precautions, nothing! We said, no this is no good! We’re not going to last here! And they said “Well where you gonna go?” and we said “oh, well, we’re just going to, I don’t care where”. “You gotta pick up your money! No! Ah forget the money and we just go.” So we loaded up our car and and went back to Adelaide. So Horst was too chicken, he wouldn't stay and I said I'll look after you, it’s alright we’re only two, I’m not married, I have no kids. I can do it. No, no, I want to be by myself so he went back to, to Melbourne got his job back as a cleaner at the railways and I went to one of the, Burke's, knocked on the door. Yeah, you can have a job. So I had a car and a crew of 3 and so we did carpet laying there and that was good. But the trouble was loose lips, I said after a little while in Adelaide I go back to Germany and so when they heard that they, they sacked me! They said we don’t need anyone who is going, flitting around the world! Alright so I was without a job. Got my holiday pay and went two doors down to Dunlop’s and Dunlop’s made floor tiles and he said can you do that? Yeah, I said. I can do that. So we did floor tiles in the hospitals and all those big jobs. Woomera the rocket range up in the desert. Dunlop’s flew us over there to fix a great big new extension of the a dining hall. So the tiles of that whole place, was black and white, so it’s one black and one white. Very simple! And we did it. And we flew back home to Adelaide and then the next day, in the Adelaide Advertiser was a picture. And the boss called us in. Come, come over here? The, the troop that was over at Woomera. So we come, wondered what it was? So, he showed us the front page picture of the newly opened dining hall and there in the doorway, right in the doorway, instead of being one black and one white there were two blacks and two whites. That should have been a checkerboard but what we did we went out that way and looked through the whole the whole room and we saw everything was perfect standing on the, the direct tiles that were wrong. They had to fly us back for four tiles to Woomera. But anyway, I got another free trip out of it so that was, that was good. But just think? The Advertiser? The main paper had the picture of Dunlop's people doing a thing like that? Black and white! You can’t go wrong. Sure enough, you can.

I’m Colin, welcome!” You know as we singing during the evening, I thought to myself, what does this guy want? Is he hungry? Thirsty? Is he looking for a bed for the night? Or what does he want? He just kept smiling at me and said “I just want to meet people.” Well that was the beginning of an everlasting friendship. When Manfred arrived in Adelaide, he knew no one. He went to the German club to meet people and get involved in activities in the local community and that’s where he saw the notice for the Friday night choir practice at St. Stephen’s. Manfred regularly attended church services and youth meetings and also continued coming along to choir practice. Gradually I thought “well this German guy, well he’s OK’ he’s alright. We also discovered that we had the same silly sense of humour. It didn’t take too long for Manfred to notice a young lady who was involved in the youth program and a very regular attendant at church.
