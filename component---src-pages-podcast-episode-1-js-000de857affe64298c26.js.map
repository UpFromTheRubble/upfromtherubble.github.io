Berlin.<br />\n                        I was born when Hitler was in power it was just the start of his regime.\n                        Through the depression in 1933, Germany was bereft of nearly everything\n                        and the long queues and no money no jobs and Hitler was the man that put\n                        the butter on the table as well as the bread and he promised every\n                        German an oil lamp with their own oil from Arabia within a very short\n                        time and the Germans fell for it, because they had no jobs and he was\n                        supplying it.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        Radio announcing commencement of World War 2.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> I went to school during the wartime. Sparse as it was,\n                        because most of the teachers were in the war front and so we just made\n                        do with what we could get. At school we were not taught anything about\n                        the Jews, nothing. Hitler promoted that more towards the middle of\n                        the war, when the sentiment against the Jews was created because of\n                        him wanting to find a scapegoat for his troubles.<br />\n                        I used to travel to my grandmothers place near the Polish border and\n                        she had a sewing machine with a sharpening stone on the side and I\n                        used to sharpen my knives on it and she used to ask me \"do you want\n                        to sew?\" and I said \"oh yeah, I'd love to sew\" but I had never sewn\n                        up till then so she said \"go for it!\" and she gave me some material\n                        and I went for it. It was unusual for a boy to sew then. It's just\n                        like like ballet for a boy. You know you get ribbed that you sew\n                        or you dance.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> Simon, when you were a child we used to record\n                        cassettes and send them home to my mother your grandma and we\n                        called her Omi.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Cassette recording:</b></p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> This cassette is recorded in Wangaratta on the\n                        17th of July 1974</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Simon:</b> Simon Reich, 10 years old is playing Mayfly on\n                        the piano.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Cassette recording:</b>\n                        <b>Audio of Simon playing piano piece Mayfly from 1974.</b></p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Simon:</b> Here I was.

We\n                        stood just under the staircase, under a concrete\n                        staircase. A bomb came through the roof of the flats.\n                        It exploded! 200 pound bomb. Blew out the walls. The\n                        brick walls were pulling away from the middle. The\n                        roof came down, over the top and then the bricks came\n                        down on top of the roof. The dust. The bomb exploding.\n                        Not that you hear anything? When you're in the middle\n                        of an explosion you hear nothing. But we had the\n                        pressure, the enormous pressure of the bomb exploding.\n                        No noise, but it pushed us against the wall under\n                        the staircase and we were entombed, with bricks\n                        all around and fire and smoke and about 25 people\n                        with us at the same place. I was only 6 years old\n                        and  because I was the smallest they said you climb\n                        up through the bricks and you get to the top,\n                        because we were down the bottom. \"How can I do that?\"\n                        And they said \"Well the fire is behind us and the\n                        smoke drifts up, as you can see, in small curls, so\n                        there must be a hole up on the top\" and so with the\n                        pushing of my mother behind me, we slowly chambered\n                        up, through and under bricks and iron and girders\n                        and wood and I kept saying \"I can't do it! I can't\n                        do it!\" My mum behind was pushing me on and so were\n                        the others. \"You've got to get up there, we have to\n                        get out of here, before the fire catches us!\" And\n                        after 12 hours of digging and scrambling, we finally\n                        stood on top. Free, and in the air! The other people\n                        that were rescued already on the other side, they\n                        were standing waving and cheering wondering where\n                        we had come from? By then the rescuers knew where\n                        we were and they dug out the others that couldn't\n                        get out.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Cassette recording</b> from 1974.

When I sang on this tape, I was\n                        just 6 years old. I drew my strength from dad, as\n                        he was the rock of the family. So it's no surprise\n                        to me that he said he didn't feel scared during\n                        the war.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> The bombing in 1943 made us redundant\n                        of everything.  We had nothing we lost the whole lot.\n                        Our furniture. Our house. Our flat. Our friends.\n                        Everything and so my mum was an au pair in Switzerland\n                        and then in Bavaria and she knew a lady that could\n                        put us up. The only time the war came to Bavaria was\n                        when a plane came over the alps and got shot down by\n                        the Germans and the pilot and the co-pilot came down\n                        with a parachute and then they got rounded up by the\n                        Militia and taken into prison.<br />\n                        I had a sister Evelyn and she was younger. Evelyn was\n                        in Berlin the same as I, when we got bombed she was\n                        already in hospital because she had whopping cough\n                        and nobody could do anything for her at that time in\n                        Germany it was a very bad situation having whopping\n                        cough. So we went to Bavaria and had to leave Evelyn\n                        in the hospital so mum had to travel often the train\n                        trip from Berlin to Bavaria would be about 4 hours so\n                        mum had to travel the other way reverse from Bavaria\n                        to Berlin and then come back to me. 4 hours trip each\n                        way so that's 8 hours. I was never asked to go to\n                        the hospital because I was too young. I was just\n                        starting school and my mum didn't want me involved\n                        in that and on top of it, it was an infectious disease\n                        and they didn't want any children in the hospital\n                        anyway, so I couldn't come. I'd rather play with\n                        the 5 kids that were in the house that we were living\n                        in. So mum had to travel to be by her side until she\n                        died which was probably 6 months later. I didn't go\n                        to the funeral of Evelyn because people at that time\n                        didn't take any children to funerals. It was too sad.\n                        That's where it left me, at least my mother didn't.\n                        I hardly knew my sister.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Cassette recording</b> from 1974.

They thought they would blow him up but\n                        they didn't.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Audio</b> of Phillip Von Schultuss, grandson of\n                        Claus Von Stauffenberg:<br />\n                        Well the Nazi's had a firm grip on Germany and\n                        later on much of Europe. Not all German's were\n                        Nazi's, nor did they all support Hitler. In fact\n                        there was a very real resistance to him within\n                        Germany. Hello, I'm  Phillip Von Schultuss and\n                        my grandfather Claus Von Stauffenberg was the\n                        military leader of the resistance group that\n                        attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler and take\n                        charge of Government on 20th July 1944. In a\n                        plot known as Operation Valkerie.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> When Hitler found out that this\n                        rechsanwalt, the lawyer was involved in the\n                        assassination attempt they rounded him up and\n                        took him to Berlin and that was the end that we\n                        ever heard of him. He got shot! So then we had\n                        to flee.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Simon:</b> When the Hollywood movie Valkyrie,\n                        starring Tom Cruise was released, dad shared\n                        this secret he'd kept all these years. Claus\n                        von Stauffenberg had amassed a team of\n                        co-conspirators to kill Hitler and my dad just\n                        happened to be living in one of their houses,\n                        eventually becoming great friends with their\n                        five children. So dad's flippant \"We had to\n                        flee again\", was actually much more serious than\n                        he portrayed. Hitler, in his bloodthirsty revenge,\n                        wanted everyone connected with the plot against\n                        him killed. More than 7000 people were arrested\n                        and 4980 were executed.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> The next time we had an incident,.\n                        that was my mum decided to go back to Berlin.\n                        We went with a train from the Polish border straight\n                        through trying to get to Berlin and halfway\n                        through we were in Chemnitz, which is the middle\n                        of Germany trying to board the train and did\n                        eventually get into the train, which was about a\n                        kilometre long and lots of people lots of lots of\n                        lots of people trying to get out of the city and\n                        the train was not allowed to stay in the station\n                        because that was the law when the alarm was raised\n                        the train had to be vacated. So the train moved\n                        out of the station and it wasn't very long and my\n                        mum and I were standing at the door of the carriage\n                        and then the next minute we felt and heard the\n                        splintering of glass and everything and the train\n                        started tilt downwards to the embankment. So what\n                        happened, which we found out later, the German had\n                        mined the sides of the railway tracks to blow it up\n                        whenever the time came. The Americans were overhead\n                        bombing us but they didn't want to bomb the train so\n                        they bombed the sides of the railway naturally\n                        hitting the mines. The mines exploded, lifted the\n                        train up and rolled the train down the hill. The\n                        door opened, mum and I went out and rolled down\n                        the hill. But then I looked at my mum who was lying\n                        next to me virtually and she had two broken legs\n                        and there were ambulances and people running\n                        forwards and backwards with stretchers and in\n                        the end we heard there were about 1000 people dead\n                        on that one very 1 day. But the strange thing was\n                        I had a rucksack. There was a cuckoo clock in it\n                        and 12 eggs. When we looked at it, at the bottom\n                        of the hill, 12 eggs, not one broken and the\n                        cuckoo clock today is hanging at Simon's.  </p>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n        </div>\n\n    </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default PodcastEpisode1\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
