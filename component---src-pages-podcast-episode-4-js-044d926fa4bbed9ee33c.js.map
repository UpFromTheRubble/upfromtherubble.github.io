Mandy was with a bunch of girls in the same\n                        cabin around the corner. They were an extremely happy couple together and it was\n                        wonderful to see Mandy and Manfred travelling to Germany to get married. It was\n                        just a great experience. We bonded very well together. The trip took about 4 to\n                        5 weeks. It was a slow trip but an enjoyable trip. One night we had a dress-up\n                        party and we swapped our clothes around. I had the pants he had the top and then\n                        vice-a-versa.

Unlike the rest of East Germany, the Soviet sector of Berlin\n                        always had full shelves in the supermarkets and boasted the top orchestras\n                        and opera in the world. </p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Manfred:</b> Because Mandy was a foreigner and she could go into the East,\n                        I couldn't because Berliner’s weren’t allowed in anywhere.

A secret service man was heard heard to shout from the card\n                        “He’s dead!”</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Manfred:</b> I was quite deeply shocked when they assassinated John F. Kennedy.\n                        I was fishing here in Wangaratta in the river and I had my transistor with me\n                        and I heard the news that he was assassinated just very shortly after he called\n                        himself “Ich bin ein Berliner!” It really went to the cord of me. And I didn’t\n                        think anybody would shoot a president, but, I mean it has happened before and\n                        it will happen again and it’s very sad to know.</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Manfred:</b> What to do with all the bricks and mortar in a devastated city?\n                        Where would you put it? Well, there was an ingenious idea! They made a great\n                        big hill. Which they called “Teufelsberg”. “Devil’s Hill”. And it was higher\n                        than any of the high house in Berlin. Because every brick they could find was\n                        put there. Then it was planted with trees and grass and in the Winter we used\n                        to have a beautiful, beautiful ski slope and toboggan slope. That’s what we\n                        used in Winter and in Summer they used it for soap box derbies, so a wonderful\n                        place and a wonderful idea to get rid of the old mortar and part of the war\n                        that was behind us now. The whole hill is an irony. What was so bad before and\n                        so tragic, with the bombing of Berlin and the destruction of Berlin, to make a\n                        special place for recreation and fun! Because we used to play with kites, skis\n                        and soap boxes. All from the rubble!</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEven though the war finished ah, you know, quite awhile back, in 1945 and we\n                        all thought that it was the end of everything and the future was coming\n                        up.</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Simon:</b> What have we learnt? </p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Manfred:</b> Well, nothing, we never learnt anything! People haven’t\n                        learnt!</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Simon:</b> If I think about your childhood, I think how extremely unsettling\n                        it would have been and scary.</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Manfred:</b> Children don’t feel scared. You said, that it’s unsettling,\n                        children in a war zone, maybe scary but not, unsettling. When you see pictures\n                        of the war now, the wars that we have got, you will always find the children\n                        playing, scooters and ball and all that, they couldn’t care less what the\n                        adults were doing, or what the bombings are doing. They sure are scared at\n                        the time when it happens, but then kids rally very quickly and forget about\n                        it.</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Simon:</b> So did you think that kids have got resilience?</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Manfred:</b> Aw! Fantastic resilience! Because you can see me at 6 years\n                        under the house for 12 hours, that was it! But, forgotten, except for the memory\n                        that is ingrained and that will never go. But I mean that doesn’t, doesn’t\n                        result in hate or anything like that. Adversity always makes a man stronger\n                        and that’s what I found, in my life, that whenever there was a problem, I went\n                        back to what did I do before? And I solved the problem. The war sort of did\n                        help and so, you’re not bereft of things when things do happen but you always\n                        sort of seems to get a way through, somehow.</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Simon:</b> Do you wish that you had had a childhood that was much more\n                        calm?</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Manfred:</b> Nah! Even though I had the childhood that I had, during the\n                        war time, I was still privileged to be with my grandmother and playing, um,\n                        cops and robbers and whatever else? I still had freedom to do what I wanted\n                        to do. Most times, except for the very end time, then, that was just\n                        different, you know. Once we were in the bunker, that’s it! But while we\n                        were still running around, nah.</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Simon:</b> So you don't wish that you had a life living in a home that\n                        was carefree and calm?</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Manfred:</b> Nah! Nah. It was just normal childhood experience, yeah. We\n                        were down on the street and all that sort of stuff, yeah.</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Simon:</b> So how do you think that a childhood like that has helped you\n                        in the rest of your life?</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Manfred:</b> It helps even if you have bad things happen to you, it helps\n                        you in later life, ‘cause it makes you more resilient. And, and I’m always\n                        gone for that. Because people that live in a peaceful place, they’re much softer\n                        and less able to jump out of their troubles when it comes, than people that\n                        lived and got through at the other end. </p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Simon:</b> Maybe when I was a child, that came across as you being a bit\n                        hard? That you didn’t have emotions? So what was your emotions? Were? Did you\n                        have emotions? Did you become?</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Manfred:</b> No. Nah! Thinking about my emotions? I had plenty of emotions\n                        and a used to, ah, no, it’s alright, nah, leave it at that, I think?</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmotions, you, always have emotions, whatever? You, ooh, you can’t, you can’t\n                        cut your inner person out. That inner person will come out. One way or another.\n                        Either you cry or you’re angry, or, you’re thoughtful, or. You know? There’s\n                        lot’s of emotions, there’s a lot of different emotions.</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut he just have to live through it I ‘spose?</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Simon:</b> But there you go again, being a bit tough. What about your\n                        emotions are you expressing your emotions?</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Manfred:</b> I could cry if you wanted me to?</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Simon:</b> (Moving towards his father) Actually I just want to say.</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Manfred:</b> What?</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Simon:</b> I’m very, I’m actually very impressed (embracing Manfred and\n                        patting him on the back while holding him)</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Manfred:</b> (Laughing) Go away!</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Simon:</b> No, I’m saying that </p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Manfred:</b> (Embarrassed) Are we finished yet?</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Simon:</b> No, the stuff you shared that you’ve shared.</p>\n                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>Manfred:</b> (Trying to cut the interview short) Yeah!
