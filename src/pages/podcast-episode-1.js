                        <b>Manfred:</b> The kids across the road used to call our kids Nazis,
                        because we were German and we had a German name like Reich, like the
                        German Reich and the neighbours would call us Nazis and the kids would
                        ask what that was all about, so then, at times I had to to tell them
                        all about the war and it wasn't all the best to talk about, especially
                        whatever happened you know in the bombings and the killings and all
                        that stuff and I wasn't too pleased to talk about that so we just
                        sort of cut this sort of thing short.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Simon:</b> The subject of this podcast, "Up from the rubble", is
                        Manfred Reich. A survivor from World War 2 Berlin and he just happens
                        to be my dad. The children he just talked about were my brother Henry,
                        sister Wendy and myself Simon Reich. We didn't know what a Nazi was
                        and in fact, we didn't know anything about our father's childhood in
                        Germany. This podcast will take you on a journey through Manfred's
                        life, with some of the stories only just coming to light.</p>

                        <b>Manfred:</b> Manfred Reich.1937. Berlin.<br />
                        I was born when Hitler was in power it was just the start of his regime.
                        Through the depression in 1933, Germany was bereft of nearly everything
                        and the long queues and no money no jobs and Hitler was the man that put
                        the butter on the table as well as the bread and he promised every
                        German an oil lamp with their own oil from Arabia within a very short
                        time and the Germans fell for it, because they had no jobs and he was
                        supplying it.</p>

                        <b>Manfred:</b> I went to school during the wartime. Sparse as it was,
                        because most of the teachers were in the war front and so we just made
                        do with what we could get. At school we were not taught anything about
                        the Jews, nothing. Hitler promoted that more towards the middle of
                        the war, when the sentiment against the Jews was created because of
                        him wanting to find a scapegoat for his troubles.<br />
                        I used to travel to my grandmothers place near the Polish border and
                        she had a sewing machine with a sharpening stone on the side and I
                        used to sharpen my knives on it and she used to ask me "do you want
                        to sew?" and I said "oh yeah, I'd love to sew" but I had never sewn
                        up till then so she said "go for it!" and she gave me some material
                        and I went for it. It was unusual for a boy to sew then. It's just
                        like like ballet for a boy. You know you get ribbed that you sew
                        or you dance.</p>

                        <b>Manfred:</b> Simon, when you were a child we used to record
                        cassettes and send them home to my mother your grandma and we
                        called her Omi.</p>

                        <b>Simon:</b> Simon Reich, 10 years old is playing Mayfly on
                        the piano.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Cassette recording:</b>
                        <b>Audio of Simon playing piano piece Mayfly from 1974.</b></p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Simon:</b> Here I was. At 10 year old playing the piano to
                        send a recording to my grandma in Germany. At this age, I
                        didn't have to think about aeroplanes dropping bombs out of
                        the sky, or being shot by fighter aircraft, but my dad's
                        childhood had a constant theme of ducking and weaving to
                        avoid being killed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Manfred:</b> When I saw a wave of the air planes flying
                        over dropping bombs and I could see the bombs falling then
                        I would just look for shelter.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Simon:</b> But were you frightened, were you screaming
                        and running?</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Manfred:</b> No</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Simon:</b> So to you was it more like cops and robbers?</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Manfred:</b> Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Simon:</b> Yes, because even on that tape you played me,
                        of the other guy from Germany, he said, during the war he
                        would actually play war games with his friends. So you're
                        in the war but youre still playing war games with little
                        models and so on, or just bits of rock?</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Manfred:</b> That's right.<br />
                        In 1943 we were in a flat in Berlin and the alarm was
                        raised through the sirens and we went down into the cellar
                        because the bombs were already falling.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Simon:</b> Were you scared?</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Manfred:</b> No, as a child you're never scared it!
                        We never made it to the original bunker under the house
                        because that was fortified iron, with big iron doors
                        like the ships have, those with the big handles. We
                        stood just under the staircase, under a concrete
                        staircase. A bomb came through the roof of the flats.
                        It exploded! 200 pound bomb. Blew out the walls. The
                        brick walls were pulling away from the middle. The
                        roof came down, over the top and then the bricks came
                        down on top of the roof. The dust. The bomb exploding.
                        Not that you hear anything? When you're in the middle
                        of an explosion you hear nothing. But we had the
                        pressure, the enormous pressure of the bomb exploding.
                        No noise, but it pushed us against the wall under
                        the staircase and we were entombed, with bricks
                        all around and fire and smoke and about 25 people
                        with us at the same place. I was only 6 years old
                        and  because I was the smallest they said you climb
                        up through the bricks and you get to the top,
                        because we were down the bottom. "How can I do that?"
                        And they said "Well the fire is behind us and the
                        smoke drifts up, as you can see, in small curls, so
                        there must be a hole up on the top" and so with the
                        pushing of my mother behind me, we slowly chambered
                        up, through and under bricks and iron and girders
                        and wood and I kept saying "I can't do it! I can't
                        do it!" My mum behind was pushing me on and so were
                        the others. "You've got to get up there, we have to
                        get out of here, before the fire catches us!" And
                        after 12 hours of digging and scrambling, we finally
                        stood on top. Free, and in the air! The other people
                        that were rescued already on the other side, they
                        were standing waving and cheering wondering where
                        we had come from? By then the rescuers knew where
                        we were and they dug out the others that couldn't
                        get out.</p>

                        <b>Cassette recording</b> from 1974. Wendy Reich
                        singing Winter Hello introduced by 10 year old Simon
                        Reich.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Wendy:</b> My name is Wendy. I am Manfred's
                        daughter and youngest child. You could say I was
                        the third Reich! When I sang on this tape, I was
                        just 6 years old. I drew my strength from dad, as
                        he was the rock of the family. So it's no surprise
                        to me that he said he didn't feel scared during
                        the war.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Manfred:</b> The bombing in 1943 made us redundant
                        of everything.  We had nothing we lost the whole lot.
                        Our furniture. Our house. Our flat. Our friends.
                        Everything and so my mum was an au pair in Switzerland
                        and then in Bavaria and she knew a lady that could
                        put us up. The only time the war came to Bavaria was
                        when a plane came over the alps and got shot down by
                        the Germans and the pilot and the co-pilot came down
                        with a parachute and then they got rounded up by the
                        Militia and taken into prison.<br />
                        I had a sister Evelyn and she was younger. Evelyn was
                        in Berlin the same as I, when we got bombed she was
                        already in hospital because she had whopping cough
                        and nobody could do anything for her at that time in
                        Germany it was a very bad situation having whopping
                        cough. So we went to Bavaria and had to leave Evelyn
                        in the hospital so mum had to travel often the train
                        trip from Berlin to Bavaria would be about 4 hours so
                        mum had to travel the other way reverse from Bavaria
                        to Berlin and then come back to me. 4 hours trip each
                        way so that's 8 hours. I was never asked to go to
                        the hospital because I was too young. I was just
                        starting school and my mum didn't want me involved
                        in that and on top of it, it was an infectious disease
                        and they didn't want any children in the hospital
                        anyway, so I couldn't come. I'd rather play with
                        the 5 kids that were in the house that we were living
                        in. So mum had to travel to be by her side until she
                        died which was probably 6 months later. I didn't go
                        to the funeral of Evelyn because people at that time
                        didn't take any children to funerals. It was too sad.
                        That's where it left me, at least my mother didn't.
                        I hardly knew my sister.</p>

                        <b>Henry:</b> My name is Henry Reich. I'm Manfred's
                        second son. I was 8 years old when I was playing
                        drums on this tape. When I think about it, dad was
                        8 years old and had to cope with his sister dying.
                        I just can't imagine what that would have felt
                        like if Wendy had died, because, I mean, I love my
                        sister we've had such great times growing up watching
                        her get married and have a child. She's a great
                        friend and just to not have a sister would just be
                        missing part in my life.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Manfred:</b> That lady with five kids was in a
                        quite a large house because they were quite wealthy
                        and so my first school year was down there in
                        Bavaria. But the husband was involved in Hitler's
                        army and because he was a rechsanwalt a lawyer
                        and he was involved with what we call the putsch
                        where they put that briefcase next to the table
                        and blew it up and Hitler just got schrapnel, that
                        was all. They thought they would blow him up but
                        they didn't.</p>

                        Well the Nazi's had a firm grip on Germany and
                        later on much of Europe. Not all German's were
                        Nazi's, nor did they all support Hitler. In fact
                        there was a very real resistance to him within
                        Germany. Hello, I'm  Phillip Von Schultuss and
                        my grandfather Claus Von Stauffenberg was the
                        military leader of the resistance group that
                        attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler and take
                        charge of Government on 20th July 1944. In a
                        plot known as Operation Valkerie.</p>

                        took him to Berlin and that was the end that we
                        ever heard of him. He got shot! So then we had

                        <b>Simon:</b> When the Hollywood movie Valkyrie,
                        starring Tom Cruise was released, dad shared
                        this secret he'd kept all these years. Claus
                        von Stauffenberg had amassed a team of
                        co-conspirators to kill Hitler and my dad just
                        happened to be living in one of their houses,
                        eventually becoming great friends with their
                        five children. So dad's flippant "We had to
                        flee again", was actually much more serious than
                        he portrayed. Hitler, in his bloodthirsty revenge,
                        wanted everyone connected with the plot against
                        him killed. More than 7000 people were arrested
                        and 4980 were executed.</p>

                        <b>Manfred:</b> The next time we had an incident,.
                        that was my mum decided to go back to Berlin.
                        We went with a train from the Polish border straight
                        through trying to get to Berlin and halfway
                        through we were in Chemnitz, which is the middle
                        of Germany trying to board the train and did
                        eventually get into the train, which was about a
                        kilometre long and lots of people lots of lots of
                        lots of people trying to get out of the city and
                        the train was not allowed to stay in the station
                        because that was the law when the alarm was raised
                        the train had to be vacated. So the train moved
                        out of the station and it wasn't very long and my
                        mum and I were standing at the door of the carriage
                        and then the next minute we felt and heard the
                        splintering of glass and everything and the train
                        started tilt downwards to the embankment. So what
                        happened, which we found out later, the German had
                        mined the sides of the railway tracks to blow it up
                        whenever the time came. The Americans were overhead
                        bombing us but they didn't want to bomb the train so
                        they bombed the sides of the railway naturally
                        hitting the mines. The mines exploded, lifted the
                        train up and rolled the train down the hill. The
                        door opened, mum and I went out and rolled down
                        the hill. But then I looked at my mum who was lying
                        next to me virtually and she had two broken legs
                        and there were ambulances and people running
                        forwards and backwards with stretchers and in
                        the end we heard there were about 1000 people dead
                        on that one very 1 day. But the strange thing was
                        I had a rucksack. There was a cuckoo clock in it
                        and 12 eggs. When we looked at it, at the bottom
                        of the hill, 12 eggs, not one broken and the
                        cuckoo clock today is hanging at Simon's.  </p>
