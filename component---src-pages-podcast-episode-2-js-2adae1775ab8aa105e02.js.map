The foster family did\n                        rake in the money from the government but didn't give me\n                        anything so I didn't get any food, I didn't get any water,\n                        I didn't get anything so I didn't last very long because I\n                        couldn't stand that.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Simon:</b> That's when you ran away but you couldn't go back to\n                        hospital?</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> Yeah. I had nowhere to go so, they hung a sign around\n                        my neck like Paddington Bear and they trotts us off onto the\n                        railway platform to be deported, somewhere! But I didn't want\n                        to be deported. Mum and I were inseparable. Mum was in\n                        hospital and I was now on the railway station so I crawled\n                        through under the wagons and to the end of the train and\n                        dashed to the hospital. When I got there I crawled under the\n                        bed and the nurses kept me there for the duration of my mum's\n                        hospitalisation. One of the nurses took pity on me because she\n                        saw me lying under the bed of my mother and she took me home\n                        and so I stayed with her and got food and I slept there and\n                        then in the morning she used to take me back into the hospital\n                        and I used to lie under mum's bed and got more food from the\n                        nurses.<br />\n                        At the end of war, that was May '45, we heard the rumours that\n                        the Americans were coming. But then they said no, no, the\n                        Americans can't come because the Americans were the ones with\n                        the planes to clear the way for the Russians. So the Russians\n                        were on the ground. The Americans when in the air, the Russians\n                        were on the ground so that meant that the Russians were coming\n                        into Berlin quicker than the Americans. We hoped that the\n                        Americans would take us out of the bunker, but that wasn't to\n                        be. The Russian troops were not the trained soldiers. They\n                        were the peasants of the Russian land and they were used as\n                        cannon fodder right at the start. They were the first runners\n                        in the war. The trained soldiers came after that first lot of\n                        troups and so we heard that they were killing people right\n                        left and centre and raping the women. So we were worried about\n                        the Russians. We knew the Americans would look after us, but\n                        the Russians we were not so sure?</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Simon:</b> The Soviet soldiers had a terrifying reputation during\n                        the war and civilians in their path feared looting and\n                        violence.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Audio</b> from radio reports announcing the Russian invasion\n                        of Berlin.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> So the last few days, which would have been about a week,\n                        we were in the railway bunker underground next to Hitler's bunker,\n                        who was in the middle of Berlin and we could hear and see the\n                        bombs falling on top of that bunker that Hitler had made, but\n                        nothing could penetrate it because it was too much. Food was one\n                        cup of rice kernels ,not cooked, a day and a bottle of water and\n                        they  told to chew the rice so that it sort of worked out like\n                        chewing gum in the end and it would give me some nourishment and\n                        stop the hunger pains and a little bit of water would help to\n                        just digest it. So we spent a whole week before the end of the\n                        war in that bunker next to Hitler's, as I said. The Russians\n                        came in, opened the door and said out, out you're free now.\n                        Hitler is dead!  The the ones that came into the bunker to\n                        free us, they were quite civil and they even gave us something\n                        to eat after all our time in there. We came out of the bunker\n                        and there was total disarray from everywhere. The buildings\n                        were gone. There was bricks and mortar and girders and dead\n                        horses and people lying in the street and it had to be all\n                        cleared away so, that's what we found and there was not a house\n                        that had a piece of glass in the windows that was all gone\n                        and the whole city, as you can see, most likely from the pictures,\n                        was just in ruin. The whole lot! There was still shooting because\n                        not everything was gone and not all the Germans were giving up\n                        because they didn't want to be losing the war, which was evident\n                        that they were! So the Russians were running around and the\n                        allies were flying overhead still bombing, while we were on the\n                        streets and the Russians were shooting right left and centre\n                        and where we could we go we were just in between all of that!\n                        Where would you go in a city that was bombed 98% and the 2% that\n                        was left was cracked. So we hunted around and hunted around and\n                        we finally find one room with cardboard on the windows. That\n                        sufficed for the next month or so before we found more permanent\n                        accommodation. How do you think you will manage in a place that\n                        was bombed and nothing was left? So we just had to scout around\n                        and when we had potatoes we used to peel them and we dried the\n                        potato peels and ate them as bread but we had no butter, we had\n                        no bread, we had hardly anything and everything was back on the\n                        black market and if you had money you could do something with\n                        it. If you had no money you just starved and that's what we did.\n                        We starved until we found something to eat.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Vintage radio clip</b> explaining Russian blockade and Berlin\n                        Airlift.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> The blockade of Berlin was a way of the Russians trying\n                        to starve us out and they wanted Berlin because we were a thorn\n                        in their side. Berlin was cut into four, the three Western ones\n                        France, England and America had one half and the Russian had\n                        the other half. But not forgetting that all around Berlin was\n                        Russian Territory for roughly about 300 km's and then the\n                        Americans took over after that. The American's, the English\n                        and the French let the Russians go far too far and that's why\n                        Berlin was part of the deal and they wanted us. So they wanted\n                        to starve us out, so they blockaded the three ways into Berlin\n                        with their tanks. The Russians did. And so the American's had\n                        to fly in everything and they called it the Berlin Blockade and\n                        that was between '48, 1948, which is three years after the war\n                        until '49. One whole year that the American's brought everything\n                        in. Coal, briquettes, potatoes, everything, water, everything\n                        and so that's how we survived.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Vintage radio clip</b> explaining about \"Operation little\n                        vittles\", candy dropping to Berlin children near the airport\n                        from US planes.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> We as kids, used to stay in the corner of our street\n                        and the Americans used to come past  to go to the airport\n                        and they used to throw out chocolates and doughnuts and\n                        everything edible and some of their iron rations that had\n                        chocolate and chewing gum in it. They threw it to the kids\n                        and they loved it. And the other thing was, as children we\n                        went to the airport to chase the planes because the\n                        American's would throw out handkerchiefs tied down as\n                        parachutes with chocolate and goodies tied in and we\n                        caught those, which was terrific.<br />\n                        After the ah the war there was not much infrastructure.\n                        For every job there was going, there were 400 people\n                        applying so what chance is there? So the, ah, the recruitment\n                        office told us to do something and I made a little radio\n                        and I wired it all up but it never, it never went but the\n                        thing was that I was too scared to put batteries in it or\n                        anything like that, but the recruitment officer said it\n                        was well done and he saw my intentions and said you might\n                        be better doing some handiwork. So, I got 2 job offers,\n                        an optician, or an upholsterer and I thought no, optician\n                        there’s glass, I don't want to do anything with glass, I\n                        like something to do with sewing and that sort of stuff\n                        because I used to at Grandma's place used to always sew\n                        with her sewing machine. So I went to the upholsterer and\n                        he said can you sew and I said yes I can, he said show me.\n                        I showed him. He said yeah, you’re on. So I was on, as an\n                        upholsterer and that was 1952 and  I stayed there until 4\n                        years later. I finished my apprenticeship and then I went\n                        into allied services, ah like curtains, wallpaper and all\n                        this sort of stuff that you, in Germany you learn your\n                        trade 100% whatever is in the room. If you were a painter,\n                        you learn upholstery and wallpaper, painting and cladding\n                        and all that sort of stuff and I was an upholsterer and\n                        so I learnt the painting side of it, the wallpaper and\n                        everything.

So,\n                        6 of us wanted to go around Germany but it whittled\n                        down to me in the end because one got married, one\n                        had a car, one had a girlfriend, one got sick so I\n                        was left to look after my own self. So I didn't wanna\n                        hang around any longer and I said, I go to America.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Audio clip:</b> immigration to America</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> So I went to the American consulate and said\n                        I want to go to America and they said, yeah and so I\n                        do a 1000 others! Well I said I want to get out of\n                        Berlin so what can I do and he said, well Australia's\n                        looking for somebody so go over to the Australian\n                        consulate because we had the consulates all in Berlin,\n                        so, I went to the Australian consulate and I said I\n                        want to go to America but they don’t want to take me\n                        so what about you guys? And they said yeah we'll take\n                        you! But second chance do you want to go  to New\n                        Zealand? And I said I don’t know where it is and I\n                        don't even know where Australia is and so they said\n                        well, here is the map have a look! Oh No!! I said\n                        Australia is far enough, New Zealand is too far for\n                        me. Alright, Australia it is. Sign up! So I signed up.\n                        Within 3 weeks I was on the ship to Australia. Ah to\n                        the detriment of my mother because she didn't want\n                        to lose me I was the only one child. My mum didn't\n                        believe that I would sign anything against her will\n                        and so I had to really beg and scrimp and save to\n                        get her signature, which I did. I had to promise her\n                        that I would come back and look after her.It took us\n                        3 weeks to get here. So, it was almost like an\n                        old-fashioned ship transport with the sailing\n                        ships.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Simon:</b> So once again we hear from the interview dad\n                        did in the year 2000.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Cassette Interview year 2000 audio:</b></p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Interviewer:</b> Manfred was on the same boat.

So,\n                        the Castelle Felice (ship name) actually started\n                        in England, coming across to Bremer Hafen picking\n                        up the German’s but there were a lot of\n                        Hungarian’s. </p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Interviewer:</b> Did you have much to do with the\n                        Hungarian’s?</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> Yes, we used to go to English classes\n                        together and then practice the English on each\n                        other.

And we thought we’ll never get\n                        anywhere. We went through Bremer Hafen and then\n                        around the Mediterranean and even in the\n                        Mediterranean we couldn’t see any land, because\n                        they always go outside the three mile limit and\n                        so we thought we’ll never get anywhere and then\n                        we went through the Suez, which was good, the\n                        Suez canal and then coming out on the other side\n                        in Aden, we hit wind 12. There were only about\n                        three people eating that day! (laughter from\n                        all around the interview table) It was fantastic!\n                        The boat used to go right up and right down and\n                        when you slept in the bed, you were standing up\n                        in the bed virtually, that’s how high the waves\n                        were.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Interviewer:</b> So who did you travel with?</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> By myself.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Interviewer:</b> Just by yourself?</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Female voice:</b> How old were you?</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> 21</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Interviewer:</b> Did you have family that you left\n                        behind?</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> Yes all.

We landed in Fremantle and it\n                        was 45ﾟc and we walked around the town and\n                        thought it was fabulous because the cars were\n                        only 300 pounds and in Germany there were no\n                        cars because of the war, so, we thought ah,\n                        we’ve come to heaven! Wonderful! So we walked\n                        around in 45ﾟc heat had ice creams and\n                        drinks and all that sort of stuff, which\n                        was good. Back on the ship going along The\n                        Bight and Australia was burning from one\n                        end to the other.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Simon:</b> The crew members of the ship,\n                        Castille Felice, loved to put the fear\n                        into the new immigrants and they easily\n                        achieved that by pointing out the\n                        bushfires raging across the great Australian\n                        Bight. </p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> So then in 3 days we were in\n                        Melbourne. Guess what? In Melbourne it was\n                        snowing and sleeting and we couldn't believe\n                        it, 45c in Fremantle and 0c and snowing in\n                        Melbourne. So then we had to board the train,\n                        going towards Bonegilla. Bonegilla was an\n                        American army camp, right here on the border\n                        of New South Wales Albury and Victoria. The\n                        American’s had gone by anyway that was empty\n                        and so they said it was alright for the\n                        migrants to come in.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Vintage radio clip</b> explaining to\n                        Australians the Bonegilla camp and new migrants.</p>\n                    <p>\n                        <b>Manfred:</b> And it took us eight hours from Melbourne \n                        o get to Bonegila. Coming back to Bonegilla after\n                        the snow and ice in Melbourne, it was back to 45c\n                        and we thought it was marvelous because there was\n                        a big lake and we could go swimming and it was freedom!\n                        There was grass and everything, but they told us not\n                        to walk through the grass because there were snakes\n                        and spiders and not to dive into the lake because\n                        there was barbed wire there and we could get tangled\n                        up. Within the first two days, we had three people\n                        dead! Two tangled up in the wire in the lake and one\n                        person had a BMW on the ship, motorbike and he went\n                        on to Melbourne to pick it up and he had a heat\n                        stroke, there was no helmets at that time. He had a\n                        heat stroke and he died on the way up to Bonegilla.\n                        So we had three dead people in the first ten\n                        days.</p>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n        </div >\n\n    </Layout >\n)\n\nexport default PodcastEpisode2\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
