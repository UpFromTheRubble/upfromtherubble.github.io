Mum and I were inseparable. Mum was in hospital and I was now on the railway station so I crawled through under the wagons and to the end of the train and dashed to the hospital. When I got there I crawled under the bed and the nurses kept me there for the duration of my mum's hospitalisation. One of the nurses took pity on me because she saw me lying under the bed of my mother and she took me home and so I stayed with her and got food and I slept there and then in the morning she used to take me back into the hospital and I used to lie under mum's bed and got more food from the nurses.",n.createElement("br",null),"At the end of war, that was May '45, we heard the rumours that the Americans were coming. But then they said no, no, the Americans can't come because the Americans were the ones with the planes to clear the way for the Russians. So the Russians were on the ground. The Americans when in the air, the Russians were on the ground so that meant that the Russians were coming into Berlin quicker than the Americans. We hoped that the Americans would take us out of the bunker, but that wasn't to be. The Russian troops were not the trained soldiers. They were the peasants of the Russian land and they were used as cannon fodder right at the start. They were the first runners in the war. The trained soldiers came after that first lot of troups and so we heard that they were killing people right left and centre and raping the women. So we were worried about the Russians.

Food was one cup of rice kernels ,not cooked, a day and a bottle of water and they  told to chew the rice so that it sort of worked out like chewing gum in the end and it would give me some nourishment and stop the hunger pains and a little bit of water would help to just digest it. So we spent a whole week before the end of the war in that bunker next to Hitler's, as I said. The Russians came in, opened the door and said out, out you're free now. Hitler is dead!  The the ones that came into the bunker to free us, they were quite civil and they even gave us something to eat after all our time in there. We came out of the bunker and there was total disarray from everywhere. The buildings were gone. There was bricks and mortar and girders and dead horses and people lying in the street and it had to be all cleared away so, that's what we found and there was not a house that had a piece of glass in the windows that was all gone and the whole city, as you can see, most likely from the pictures, was just in ruin. The whole lot! There was still shooting because not everything was gone and not all the Germans were giving up because they didn't want to be losing the war, which was evident that they were! So the Russians were running around and the allies were flying overhead still bombing, while we were on the streets and the Russians were shooting right left and centre and where we could we go we were just in between all of that! Where would you go in a city that was bombed 98% and the 2% that was left was cracked. So we hunted around and hunted around and we finally find one room with cardboard on the windows. That sufficed for the next month or so before we found more permanent accommodation. How do you think you will manage in a place that was bombed and nothing was left? So we just had to scout around and when we had potatoes we used to peel them and we dried the potato peels and ate them as bread but we had no butter, we had no bread, we had hardly anything and everything was back on the black market and if you had money you could do something with it. If you had no money you just starved and that's what we did.

Berlin was cut into four, the three Western ones France, England and America had one half and the Russian had the other half. But not forgetting that all around Berlin was Russian Territory for roughly about 300 km's and then the Americans took over after that. The American's, the English and the French let the Russians go far too far and that's why Berlin was part of the deal and they wanted us. So they wanted to starve us out, so they blockaded the three ways into Berlin with their tanks. The Russians did. And so the American's had to fly in everything and they called it the Berlin Blockade and that was between '48, 1948, which is three years after the war until '49.

For every job there was going, there were 400 people applying so what chance is there? So the, ah, the recruitment office told us to do something and I made a little radio and I wired it all up but it never, it never went but the thing was that I was too scared to put batteries in it or anything like that, but the recruitment officer said it was well done and he saw my intentions and said you might be better doing some handiwork. So, I got 2 job offers, an optician, or an upholsterer and I thought no, optician there’s glass, I don't want to do anything with glass, I like something to do with sewing and that sort of stuff because I used to at Grandma's place used to always sew with her sewing machine. So I went to the upholsterer and he said can you sew and I said yes I can, he said show me. I showed him. He said yeah, you’re on. So I was on, as an upholsterer and that was 1952 and  I stayed there until 4 years later. I finished my apprenticeship and then I went into allied services, ah like curtains, wallpaper and all this sort of stuff that you, in Germany you learn your trade 100% whatever is in the room. If you were a painter, you learn upholstery and wallpaper, painting and cladding and all that sort of stuff and I was an upholsterer and so I learnt the painting side of it, the wallpaper and everything.
